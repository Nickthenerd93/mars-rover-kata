# Mars Rover

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2022).

## Abstract

Youâ€™re part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles to the surface of the planet. Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.

## Required Features:
- setup the planet with a starting point for the rover
- Implement wrapping at edges. But be careful, planets are spheres. Connect the x edge to the other x edge, so (1,1) for x-1 to (5,1), but connect vertical edges towards themselves in inverted coordinates, so (1,1) for y-1 connects to (5,1)
- implement basic communication interface between operator and rover via character array of commands
- Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b)
- Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r)
- Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle
- Implement a detection feature, which distinguish between rocks, craters and martians. If the obstacle is an martian, the rover has to shoot a picture (ASCII-Alien in console)
